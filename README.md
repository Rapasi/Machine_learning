# Machine learning examples

### This repo contains some examples of ML models for solvin classification tasks. All models use freely available data from Kaggle.  

#### Hotel folder contains binary classification problem for hotel reservation cancellation predictions. 
- This is an example of using random forest algorithm in Python. 

#### Flovers folder contains a multiclass classification problem where ANN is used to classify images of different flovers.   
- This is an example of using ANN in Ternsorflow and Keras.


#### Bankrupt folder contains binary classification problem for bankrupt predictions.
- Contains random forest and ANN classifiers. 

### Be aware that the codes are undocumented because they were never intended to be published! I will try to add some documentation if I have time.
